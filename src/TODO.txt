Things that we might want to do:

Fix regressions post boost lib change: connect/disconnect doesn't work as it used to at all.
Fix 3 warnings, unused var, two case statements with enum value unhandled
Add -Wall -Werror to g++ call so warnings don't slip in, helps keep code tidy
Make it build on mac and windows
Improve readme file
Remove disused XDP radio button
Remove GO button
Listen for ctrl q and exit

DONE Move all source to src/
DONE Move char delay to advanced or remove it, do we need it?  NO not with boost.
