Things that we might want to do:

Fix regressions post boost lib change: connect/disconnect doesn't work as it used to at all.
Fix 3 warnings, unused var, two case statements with enum value unhandled
Move all source to src/
Add -Wall -Werror to g++ call so warnings don't slip in, helps keep code tidy
Make it build on mac and windows
Improve readme file
Remove disused XDP radio button
Remove GO button
Move char delay to advanced or remove it, do we need it?
Listen for ctrl q and exit
